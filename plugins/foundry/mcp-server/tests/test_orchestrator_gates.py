"""Regression tests for Casting C3 — orchestrator gate fixes (NFR-001).

Two behavioral areas, one test (or more) per acceptance criterion:

P3 (FR-003 / FR-004 / ST-001) — verdict synthesis on clean PROVE:
  the F4 router's auto-pass path synthesizes a VERIFIED verdict for every
  spec requirement ID into verdicts.json BEFORE emitting the auto-pass, so
  the DONE gate's ``verdict_coverage`` read is N/N rather than 0/N.

P4 (FR-005 / FR-008 / ST-002) — passing-gate guidance advance + token decouple:
  a passing Foundry-Gate advances the guidance state (next Foundry-Next
  emits the transition step, not a re-run of the satisfied gate); and the
  ``.next-action-called`` ordering token is decoupled from the stall clock
  (now ``.last-next-at``) so gate/phase consumption and read-only intervening
  calls do not blind the watchdog, while real stalls still warn.

NFR-002 — no regression: the refactored ``_count_spec_requirements`` counts
identically, and synthesis is a no-op when verdicts are already complete.

US-004 (AC-013 / AC-014, + D-008) — every INSPECT stream is recordable:
  ``research_audit`` and ``flow_trace`` join the ``Foundry-Stream`` valid set
  (AC-013), and ``coverage_diff`` joins per the D-008 lead ruling ("all
  streams the phase guide defines" — coverage_diff is the MIGRATION-run F2
  stream the orchestrator's own next-action guidance names). All are
  recordable, NOT required. The MCP tool's JSON-Schema enum and the runtime
  guard agree exactly, and markers written by the old build still load.

US-006 (FR-013 / CT-002 / AC-018 / AC-019 / OT-007 / NFR-002) — the MCP surface
  accepts what the protocol produces: the stream, source and defect_type
  vocabularies are READ from schemas/vocab.py at every site rather than
  re-typed, ``test01`` joins the recordable set, ``foundry_sync_defects``
  validates source and type and preserves the recorded source verbatim instead
  of silently coercing it to "trace", and unknown values are refused with a
  named error.

FR-019 — the directive channel: urgent and normal directives are BOTH rendered
  (the ``elif`` suppressed every standing normal directive after the first
  urgent one), and Foundry-Clear preserves what it cleared.

AC-023 / CT-004 — the registration halves this casting owns: ``casting_commit``
  reaches ``foundry_accept_casting`` over MCP, and ``Foundry-Liveness`` is
  declared and dispatched.

Two claims from earlier versions of this file moved on purpose, both because
the behaviour they pinned is what FR-014 / FR-020 deliberately change:
  - the marker-write coverage-drop comparison → test_stream_rollup.py, now
    cycle N vs cycle N-1;
  - ``sight`` being required whenever ``no_ui`` is false → now driven by
    whether any casting key_file actually carries a UI extension (AC-025).

All tests are hermetic: ``_check_active_teams`` is monkeypatched inactive so
no test depends on the ambient tmux session or ~/.claude/teams state.
